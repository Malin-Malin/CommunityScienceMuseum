                        There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very welcome and are an
                        important

                        <h2>Volunteer</h2>
                        <p>
                            A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and
                            ready
                            for visitors to come
                            and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a
                            working
                            museum, access to
                            staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
                            discuss
                            ideas for future
                            exhibits and strategies for the museum.
                            You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to
                            find
                            out more about how
                            you can get involved.
